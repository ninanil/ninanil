# Projects and Skills

## Key Projects

### **Generative AI Toolkit**
#### **MovieChat: Conversational AI for Movies**
- Built a framework to preprocess movie-related datasets and fine-tune LLaMA2 models using **QLoRA** and **Unsloth**.
  - **Data Preparation**:
    - Processed diverse datasets, including **Cornell Movie Dialogues** and **MovieQA**, enriched with IMDb metadata.
    - Utilized **Weights & Biases (W&B)** and the **Hugging Face Hub** for version control and dataset sharing.
  - **Model Fine-Tuning**:
    - Leveraged advanced techniques like **QLoRA** for efficient fine-tuning.
    - Managed experiment tracking with **DagsHub**, **MLflow**, and **W&B**.
  - **Key Tools and Libraries**: Hydra, DVC, IMDbPY, and PyTorch.
### **Data Visualization Dashboard**
- Built an interactive dashboard with **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **SQL** to analyze large datasets.

### **API Development**
- Designed and deployed APIs for machine learning models using **FastAPI** and **Flask**.
  - **Imageverse Web App**: An AI-powered application for generating images based on text prompts with customizable transformations and captioning uploaded images with object detection.
### Feature and Classifier-Level Domain Adaptation in DistilHuBERT for Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition

Developed a robust **Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition (CCSER)** model using **DistilHuBERT** self-supervised speech representations. Implemented **Feature-Level Domain Adaptation** and **Classifier-Level Domain Adaptation** to enhance performance across diverse datasets. Key contributions include:

- **Feature Extractors:** Integrated **wav2vec** and **WavLM**, adapting features at various layers.
- **Classifiers:** Used **SVM** and other classifiers with **Multi-Head Attention** and **Conformer Blocks**.
- **Loss Functions:** Applied contrastive loss and other advanced techniques in a **Siamese Network** for domain shift minimization.

This approach improved cross-corpus generalization by refining feature and classifier-level adaptation strategies.
### Object Detection with Advanced Models

Implemented object detection models like **R-CNN**, **Fast R-CNN**, **Faster R-CNN**, **R-FCN**, and **YOLO** using the **PASCAL VOC** dataset. Focused on comparing their performance and optimizing detection accuracy.
